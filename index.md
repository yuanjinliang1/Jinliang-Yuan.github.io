## Jinliang Yuan  袁进良

I'm a postdoctor at Tsinghua University, working with [Prof. Yunhao Liu](http://tns.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~yunhao/en.html). I received my doctoral and bachelor's degrees from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2023 and 2016, co-advised by [Prof. Shangguang Wang](http://www.sguangwang.com/) and [Prof. Mengwei Xu](https://xumengwei.github.io/). Additionally, I feel fortunate to receive remote guidance from [Prof. Yuanchun Li](https://yuanchun-li.github.io/) in at Tsinghua University. Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](/cv-yuan.pdf).
